# Digital Clock Project

This project implements a simple digital clock with additional features such as setting alarms, customizing appearance, and selecting time zones. The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using Java Swing.

## Project Structure

- **Main.java:** Contains the main method to run the digital clock.
- **DigitalClock.java:** Implements the digital clock functionality.
- **SetAlarmFrame.java:** Handles the setting and triggering of alarms.
- **TimeZoneSettings.java:** Provides functionality to set the time zone.
- **DigitalClockAppearanceSettings.java:** Allows users to customize the appearance of the digital clock.

## Instructions to Run the Project

1. **Compile and Run Main.java:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the "src" folder.
   - Compile and run the "Main.java" file to start the digital clock:
